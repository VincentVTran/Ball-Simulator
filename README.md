This is my first attempt for implementing a neural network into objects. The objective is to develop a mechanism for the subject, the blue circle, to avoid walls.

To install- <br/>
`git clone https://github.com/VincentVTran/Neural-Network-Maze.git`

DISCLAIMER:
You may need to build the package in an IDE before running the programming (the main class is Maze.Main.java).
