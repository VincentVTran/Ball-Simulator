**Introduction** <br/>
This is my first attempt for implementing a neural network into objects. The objective is to develop a mechanism for the subject, the blue circle, to avoid walls.


**Progression** <br/>
-Create foundation[X]<br/>
-Complete GUI[X] <br/>
-Complete working collision mechanism[ ]<br/>
-Create a maze[X]<br/>
-Implement neural network[ ] <br/>
(Might use genetic algorithm to back propogate)


**Instruction** <br/>

_To install-_ <br/>
`git clone https://github.com/VincentVTran/Neural-Network-Maze.git`

**DISCLAIMER:**
You may need to build the package in an IDE before running the programming (the main class is Maze.Main.java).
