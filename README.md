**Introduction** <br/>
This is my first attempt for implementing a neural network into objects. The objective is to develop a mechanism for the subject, the blue circle, to avoid walls.

**Instruction** <br/>
_Changing Scenes(Temporary)-_ <br/>
To change scenes, simply go Maze.Main.java and replace the current root with the desired FXML file.

_To install-_ <br/>
`git clone https://github.com/VincentVTran/Neural-Network-Maze.git`

**Development GUI Scene:**

**DISCLAIMER:**
You may need to build the package in an IDE before running the programming (the main class is Maze.Main.java).
